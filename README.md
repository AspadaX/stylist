# stylist
See if the clothes are suited for you. The current project is still in 
early-development phase, which means that bug may happen, and only recommended
for developers or people who are technically savvy. 

# Features
- Upload multiple clothing images (can be added anytime).
- Upload a single face image.
- Compute similarities between the face image and the uploaded clothing images.
- Display recommended clothes sorted by similarity scores.

# Installations
This project is separated into a Rust RESTful API backend and a frontend written
in Python with `streamlit`. You may need to compile the Rust backend and then
start it first before run the UI in `main.py`. 

# Contributions
Contributions are more than welcomed. Just submit an issue or a PR if you
